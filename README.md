## Task

Create a website on a subject of my choice
- Use Bootstrap3.3.7
- Make website responsive
- Include a navigation bar
- Must be three pages

My website subject is guitars.  There are many brands of guitars, with each brand having many models and sub models.  This topic lends itself to a website as this structure can be used to represent webpages that link together in a cohesive manner.

My first page `index.html` is my home page
the page is broken into a header and then two columns of information. These columns can then be stacked using bootsrap and the selecting a broader column size when the screen width decreases, allowing for a more user friendly design  

```HTML
<section class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"> ```

Page 2 `pages/page1.html` 

better to use semantic tags instead of divs, better for screen readers more readable
Also use the H numbers properly only use 1 H tag per webpage

Tables <tr> tablerow count the <tr> tags

initialise with readme, git puts readme in top level of depository, git expects a README.md in the top level
